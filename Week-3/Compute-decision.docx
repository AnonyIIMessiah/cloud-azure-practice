Options Considered
Option	Description	Pros	Cons	Best for
Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)	Traditional IaaS compute with full OS control	Full control over OS and runtime; supports legacy workloads	Requires patching, scaling, monitoring; slower to deploy	Custom OS needs, legacy systems
Azure App Service	PaaS web hosting environment	Fast deployment, managed scaling, built-in CI/CD, SSL, monitoring	Limited control over OS and networking; some cold start for scaling	Web apps & APIs needing fast time-to-market
Azure Container Apps	Serverless container orchestration	Supports microservices, Dapr, scale to zero, no cluster management	Slightly higher learning curve; fewer custom VM options	Containerized workloads & microservices
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)	Managed Kubernetes	Fine-grained control, scalable, supports multi-container apps	High operational overhead; cluster management needed	Large-scale microservices ecosystems
Trade-offs: Operations vs Speed
Factor	App Service	Container Apps	Virtual Machines
Operational Overhead	Low (fully managed)	Medium (containers, but no cluster)	High (full OS management)
Deployment Speed	Very fast (CI/CD ready)	Fast	Slower (manual config)
Scalability	Auto-scaling built-in	Serverless scale to zero	Manual or ASG setup
Flexibility/Customization	Limited	High (custom container image)	Full control
Security Patch Management	Managed by Azure	Managed by Azure	Managed by user
Cost Efficiency (Low Usage)	Good	Best (scale-to-zero)	Poor (always-on)
Decision

For rapid development, deployment, and low ops, Azure App Service was selected.

If containerization or microservice architecture is adopted later, Azure Container Apps can be the next evolution.

VMs are rejected due to maintenance and scalability overhead.
